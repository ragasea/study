    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p><strong>Gavin Maxwell</strong> (1914–1969) was a Scottish naturalist and writer. He is best known for <em>Ring of Bright Water</em>, a book describing his life with otters in Scotland. Maxwell had a deep affection for animals and wrote from his personal experiences.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="note-box">
      <p>This chapter is an extract from <em>Ring of Bright Water</em>. The author recounts his experience of keeping an otter as a pet during his stay in Iraq (Basra) and later bringing it to England. The otter—named <strong>Mijbil</strong> (often called <em>Mij</em>)—becomes a close companion, showing intelligence, playfulness, and a strong love for water.</p>
    </div><h3>First Encounter</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The author originally considered a dog but was offered an otter instead.</li>
  <li>Mijbil arrived as a shy baby, hiding in a box, but gradually explored and bonded with the author.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mijbil’s Nature</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intelligent, curious, mischievous, and affectionate.</li>
  <li>Had a natural instinct for swimming and loved water more than land.</li>
  <li>Invented playful games (marbles, rubber balls, broken suitcases) and displayed quick learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Journey to England</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bringing Mijbil to England presented practical problems (air travel restrictions for exotic pets).</li>
  <li>Mijbil created a commotion at the airport and on the plane but charmed many people with his antics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Life in London</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mijbil attracted attention on walks—people often misidentified him (seal, beaver, squirrel, even walrus!).</li>
  <li>Otters were rare as pets, so Mijbil was a constant source of fascination.</li>
</ul>
