      <h2>About the Poet</h2>
      <p><strong>John Berryman (1914–1972)</strong> was an American poet noted for his emotionally intense and reflective poetry. He often wrote about loss, guilt, and the human condition. <em>The Ball Poem</em> is short but rich in meaning — it uses a child's lost ball to explore loss, responsibility, and growing up.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The poem describes a boy who loses his ball by the sea or harbor. The ball bounces away and falls into the water; the boy cannot retrieve it. The poet watches and reflects: this accidental loss is the boy’s first real encounter with disappointment and loss. No one can give him the exact ball back — an experience, once gone, cannot be replaced by money or another object. The incident teaches the child about loss and forces him to accept the reality of the world.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Key point:</strong> The ball is more than an object — it symbolizes childhood innocence, attachment, and the inevitability of loss.

      </ul>

        <p class="meta">— Shows immediate shock, helplessness and the poet's concern. The repetition "What, what" emphasizes confusion and pain.</p>

        <p class="meta">— Suggests that people may trivialize the loss; the emotional value cannot be replaced by buying another ball.</p>

        <p><strong>"Money is external. It can buy a new ball or a story." </strong></p>
        <p class="meta">— Money buys objects but not the exactness of the lost experience or memory.</p>

        <p><strong>"Let him be left, nor speak of him as lost."</strong></p>

      <h2>Exam-style Q&A (Short & Long Answers)</h2>

      <div class="qa">
        <div class="card">
          <strong>Q1. What is the theme of <em>The Ball Poem</em>?</strong>
          <p><em>Ans:</em> The poem deals with loss and the process of growing up. It shows how the boy’s loss of the ball teaches him about sorrow, the value of experience, and acceptance of reality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Q2. Why does the poet say 'Money is external'?</strong>
          <p><em>Ans:</em> The poet means money can buy a new ball but cannot restore the exact feeling, memory or attachment the lost ball had. Emotional experiences are not replaceable by money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Q3. How does the poet view the reaction of others?</strong>
          <p><em>Ans:</em> The poet suggests others may trivialize the loss and offer substitutes or jokes. But such reactions miss the emotional lesson — the poet urges that the boy’s grief should be respected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <strong>Q4. Write a long-answer (100–150 words): Explain how loss in the poem leads to maturity.</strong>
          <p><em>Ans:</em> The loss of the ball is a small incident but symbolically significant. It is the boy’s first confrontation with irreversible loss. The shock and helplessness force him to experience grief, a feeling previously unknown. Through this event he learns that not everything can be retrieved or replaced, and that possessions often carry emotional weight beyond their monetary value. The poet suggests that such moments teach responsibility and acceptance: the child must come to terms with reality. This inner change—learning to cope and move forward—marks the beginning of maturity.</p>
