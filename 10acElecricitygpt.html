    <h1>Electricity – Class 10 Notes</h1>
    <p><strong>Electric circuit:</strong> A closed loop is required for current to flow and power devices. An <em>open</em> circuit breaks the loop, stopping current. A closed circuit completes the path so electrons move and lights/loads work. Electric <strong>current</strong> (I) is the rate of flow of electric charge (Q/t)11, usually via electrons in a conductor. Its SI unit is the ampere (A), equal to one coulomb per second12. Electric <strong>potential difference</strong> (voltage, V) is the work per unit charge to move charge between two points13. It “pushes” charges through the circuit; 1 V = 1 joule per coulomb.</p>
    <p><strong>Ohm’s Law:</strong> In ohmic materials, current is proportional to voltage14. We write <em>V = I·R</em> (hence <em>I = V/R</em>), where <strong>R</strong> is resistance (Ω). Resistance measures how much a material opposes current; materials with free electrons (metals) have low R, insulators (rubber, glass) have very high R. For a uniform wire of length ℓ and area A, <em>R = ρℓ/A</em>, where ρ is the resistivity of the material15. A longer or thinner wire has higher resistance.</p>
    <h2>Series and Parallel Circuits</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Series_and_parallel_circuits.svg/2560px-Series_and_parallel_circuits.svg.png" alt="Series and Parallel Circuit Diagram" class="diagram">
    <p>In a <strong>series</strong> circuit, components are end-to-end in one path. The same current flows through each, and the voltages add. The equivalent resistance is the sum: <em>R<sub>eq</sub>=R₁+R₂+…</em>16. In a <strong>parallel</strong> circuit, components share both connection points. Each branch has the same voltage, and the currents add. The reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of reciprocals: <em>1/R<sub>eq</sub>=1/R₁+1/R₂+…</em>17. Parallel circuits have lower total R than any branch, allowing more current for a given voltage.</p>
    <h2>Electric Power</h2>
    <p>Electric <strong>power</strong> (P) is the rate of energy transfer, given by <em>P = V·I</em>18 (voltage times current). In other forms, <em>P = I²R</em> or <em>P = V²/R</em>. Power is in watts (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s. For example, if 2 A flows through a 5 Ω resistor at 10 V, P = 10×2 = 20 W of power (dissipated as heat). Household appliances (lamps, heaters) are rated in watts, reflecting this heating effect of current.</p>
    <h2>Practice Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Q1: Why does a bulb glow only when the circuit is closed?</summary>
      <div><strong>Answer:</strong> A closed circuit completes the path for current. In a closed loop, current flows through the bulb so it lights. In an open circuit the path is broken, so no current reaches the bulb and it stays off.</div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Q2: State Ohm’s law with its formula.</summary>
      <div><strong>Answer:</strong> Ohm’s law states that the current (I) through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across it (at constant temperature)19. Mathematically: <em>V = I·R</em>, where R is the resistance.</div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Q3: Calculate the equivalent resistance of a 10 Ω and a 30 Ω resistor in parallel.</summary>
      <div><strong>Answer:</strong> Use 1/R<sub>eq</sub> = 1/10 + 1/30 = (3+1)/30 = 4/30. So R<sub>eq</sub> = 30/4 = 7.5 Ω.</div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Q4: A wire has ρ=1.6×10<sup>–8</sup> Ω·m, length 2 m, area 1 mm². Find its resistance.</summary>
      <div><strong>Answer:</strong> R = ρℓ/A = (1.6×10<sup>–8</sup> Ω·m)(2 m) / (1×10<sup>–6</sup> m²) = 3.2×10<sup>–2</sup> Ω.</div>
